##### CODECADEMY: FULL-STACK ENGINEER COURSE

Challenge Project: Flashcards

## Description

This is a React training/learning project, set by [Codecademy][codecademy], untilising React and Redux to create a Flashcards Application.

## Codecademy Objective

##### Overview

"Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements that describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve."

##### Project Goals

"In this project, you will practice using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. Users will be able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users will also be able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

The following task descriptions will walk through implementing the app’s Redux logic, starting with topics, then quizzes, and then cards. If you would like to implement it in a different order, feel free to do what is comfortable for you."

##### Setup Instructions

"If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. Make sure you have Node installed on your computer and then, inside the project’s root directory, run npm install. Finally, run npm start which will automatically open up a new tab in your browser with your running application. If a new tab does not appear, you can visit http://localhost:3000/."

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
